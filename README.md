# Online_Cryptography_Ads_Analysis_using_EDA

## 1. Defining the Question
### a) Specifying the Data Analytic Question
To create a model to identify which individuals are most likely to click on ads.
### b) Defining the Metric for Success
The study will be considered successful if we shall be able to get insight from the data using the Exploratory
data analysis.
### c) Understanding the context
Advertising is a means of communication with the users of a product or service. Advertisements are messages
paid for by those who send them and are intended to inform or influence people who receive them. Advertising
is always present, though people may not be aware of it. In todayâ€™s world, advertising uses every possible
media to get its message through. It does this via television, print (newspapers, magazines, journals etc),
radio, press, internet, direct selling, hoardings, mailers, contests, sponsorships, posters, clothes, events,
colours, sounds, visuals and even people (endorsements). In our model, we shall try to predict the probabilty
of a person clicking on an ad.
### d). Recording the Experimental Design
We will use exploratory data analysis, such as Univariate and Bivariate in this study to determine the
relationships and differences between different variables.
## e) Data Relevance
